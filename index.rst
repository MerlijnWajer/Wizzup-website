Welcome to Wizzup.org
=====================

My name is Merlijn (Boris Wolf) Wajer; born in Amsterdam, 16 December 1990
I am 20 years old and currently attend the University of Amsterdam.

Projects
--------

Some of my projects will be quickly covered here, all my other small projects
can be found on my git hosts, `git.wizzup.org <http://git.wizzup.org/>`_ and my
`Github account <http://github.com/MerlijnWajer>`_.

SRL
~~~

`SRL <https://villavu.com/>`_ is the first project I ever participated in and it
has mainly been the base of my current programming knowledge. SRL was
initially a library created to macroing a game called *Runescape*, but has since
turned into a community full of interesting people, talented programmers and
generally cool fruitcakes. The library still works, by the
way. SRL has lots of *Scripts* that each perform their own task on *Runescape*.

Simba
~~~~~

`SRL`_ was initially interpreted by SCAR, a closed source program. When
development of SCAR stagnated and stability decreased, I - along with other
members of the SRL community - created `Simba <http://wizzup.org/simba>`_.
Originally created to closely resemble SCAR and to provide an Open Source
alternative to it, it has now superseded SCAR on `SRL`_. Simba is GPL-3
licensed.

SRL-Stats
~~~~~~~~~
`SRL-Stats <http://wizzup.org/stats>`_ was created to keep track of the progress
and use of SRL. SRL *Scripts* can gather statistics from their actions and
submit them to SRL stats.

Currently the most popular script has ran for
*954 days, 8:49:00 with 154756 individual commits.*, which is pretty impressive.

    2011.


πϱTorrent
~~~~~~~~~

`πϱTorrent <http://wizzup.org/pyroTorrent>`_ is a web interface to rTorrent. It
was written in Python because I got so fed up with all the crappy PHP
interfaces and generally just PHP being crappy.

It is still work in progress, but it can do some basic stuff like list
and add torrents.

    downloads are illegal, so bite me)

Oh, and `πϱTorrent`_ is really fast compared to any of the PHP web interfaces.


Distributed Chat System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`DCS <http://wizzup.org/dcs/>`_ was an assignment for the University of
Amsterdam, we had to form groups and implement a chat protocol similar to IRC.
Our implementation ended up being quite cool, with only one known bug. One that
we've never bothered to fix, though.
